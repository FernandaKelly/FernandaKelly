### Hello!

I'm Fernanda Kelly, a 28-year-old native of Goiás, and a Porto Alegre native since 2020! I have a degree in Statistics and am passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a great deal of experience in time series, such as my final project, where I created the Bernoulli-ARMA model to predict whether it will rain or not. I've already "played" with a master's degree in Computer Science, but I'm currently studying Intelligent Systems at UFCSPA. I also have a postgraduate degree in Data Science from USP/ESALQ and in Project Management from FGV.

I've worked at Accenture Brazil and worked on various projects in areas such as epidemiology, geoprocessing, and marketing. I'm an expert in R and am currently exploring Python and other tools such as GitHub, Power BI, and SQL. I speak English, love French, and am dedicated to volunteer projects, such as R-Ladies Goiânia and AI Inclusive, where I also share my knowledge through lectures and courses.

Let's talk and explore the world of data!
