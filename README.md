### Hey!

My name is Fernanda Kelly, I'm 28 years old, I'm from Goiânia and I've been exploring the capital Porto Alegre since 2020. I have a degree in statistics and an enthusiast in the world of Machine and Deep Learning. During my undergraduate studies I worked with time series in voluntary projects and laboratories that studied pasture, rainfall and financial market forecasts. Given my experience and interest in the area, my TCC was the development of a new model to predict binary outcomes, such as rain or not rain. The name of this time series model is Bernoulli-ARMA.

In relation to academia, I have already “played around” a little by doing a master's degree in Computer Science, but I am currently studying a master's degree in Intelligent Systems and Applications at the Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre. I have a postgraduate degree in Data Science and Analytics from the University of São Paulo, unit Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”, better known as USP/ESALQ and in Project Management from Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV).

I worked on research projects, laboratories and worked in large companies such as Accenture Brasil. I have experience in epidemiological data analysis, image processing and geoprocessing, time series, marketing and, in relation to programming and tools, I have an advanced level in R and a basic level in Python, and I have been studying and application GitHub, Power BI, SQL in my consultancies and daily studies.

I speak English in the Brazilian way and I love French and, in relation to volunteer projects, I am the founder of the Goiânia chapter of the global organization R-Ladies and I am part of the team at the AI Inclusive organization and sometines I lecture and minister courses for this organizations.
